I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space - craft, coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all.But the samw wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined.We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space.From out there it really is 'one world'.");
